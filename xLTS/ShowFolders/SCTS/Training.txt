Confidence comes from discipline and training.

It's all to do with the training:
you can do a lot if you're properly trained.

I hated every minute of training,
but I said,
Don't quit.
Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.

I think sometimes the best training is to rest.

I had been told that the training procedure with cats was difficult.
It's not.
Mine had me trained in two days.
